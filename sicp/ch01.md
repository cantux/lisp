### Languages - Lisp (List Processor)

* Primitive Elements
* Means of combinations
* Means of abstraction

A combination consists of operators(func name, e.g ''+'' symbol)  and operands(arguments).

Lisp editors help with indenting operands in a combination.

#### Breakdown of Aspects of a Language

* Primitive Objects
    * primitive procedures
    * primitive data
* Means of Conbination
    * procedure composition
    * construction of compound data
* Means of Abstraction
    * procedure definition
    * simple data abstraction
* Capturing Common Patterns
    * high order procedures
    * data as procedures
