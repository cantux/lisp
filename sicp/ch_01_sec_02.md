## Procedures and the Processes They Generate

Now that we have ran operations, combined them and abstracted them in compound procedures, it looks as if we know programming.

How ever we have but learned how to move pieces on a chess board. We are far from understanding the tactics and strategy requires to become a player.

We lack the experience to predict the consequences of making a move.


Ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under the consideration is crucial to becoming an expert programmer.
Just as in any synthetic creative activity.

In becmoing an expert photographer, for example, one must learn how to look at a scene and know how dark each region will appear
on a print for each possible choice of exposure and development conditions.

Only then photographer can reason backwards to create the scene he pleases.


IN this section we will examine some common "shapes" for processes generated by simple procedures.

### 2.1 Linear iterative and recursive processes

Factorial


### 2.2 Tre Recursion

Fibonacci
Coin Change

### 2.3 Orders of Growth

### 2.4 Exponentiation

Consider the problem of computing the exponential of a given number.

```
(define (expt b n)
    (if (= n 0))
        1
        (* n (expt b (- n 1))))


(define (expt b n)
    (define (expt_int b n curr res)
        (if (= n curr)
            res
            (expt_int b n (+ 1 curr) (* res b))))
    (expt_int b n 0 1)
    )
```

Use a little arithmetic trick to make this logarithmic complexity.

(b^n)^2 = b^2n..

^2 = b^2n..

^2 = b^2n..
