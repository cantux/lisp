## Intro

Directory follows 6.001 and SICP text document.

This will include notes on topics that I deem important or that I think I don't have a good hangdle on or bread crumbs thinking tools etc.

## Chapter 0

Started reading chapter 1.

Installed mit-scheme. While going through scheme user manual. Found that Emacs can be fired internally from scheme and even use it in REPL mode.

I think there is going to be value in that, also vim's lack of term window at early versions and messy ctags support may have gone far enough.

### Analogy from Geometry

Geometry is union of GHAIA and METRY, surveying earth.

This is a fallacy that happens when a new field is just getting started, people confuse the task/action or tools 
with the knowledge.

Geometry formalizes the notion of space time and later led to axiomatic methods for dealing with declerative, "WHAT IS", kind of knowledge.

By analogy to geometry Computer Science is not really about computers. It is about dealing with imperative, "HOW IS", kind of knowledge.

### Languages - Lisp (List Processor)

* Primitive Elements
* Means of combinations
* Means of abstraction

A combination consists of operators(func name, e.g ''+'' symbol)  and operands(arguments).

Lisp editors help with indenting operands in a combination.
